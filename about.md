As a Master’s student in Boston University, I am doing systematic research and extensive application of machine learning algorithms for solving problems in various domains such as computer vision, speech processing and natural language processing. Mathematics has always been my forte right from my high school, combined with a strong background in signal processing I developed a clean understanding of basics of machine learning. 

Ever since I realized the potential of ML, I have been a strong advocator of its potential to bring a change in every technology that we use today like how the “great” internet did decades ago. As a result of which, I keep myself updated with the latest advancements in ML, technologies and products that use ML and not-to-mention endless papers on GANs.

 I am currently doing my MS thesis on “Small Variance Asymptotics for Bayesian Neural Networks”(under review - ICML 2018) which helps me in learning probabilistic ML techniques and graphical models. Alongside, with industrial experience from my summer internship I am doing research on conversation recognition which provides insights into ML for speech. In addition, I am serving as a Data Analyst intern to devise a machine learning model that predicts uncertainties in simulation results for "Captario".

Outside academia, I play keyboard, I paint and running is one of my favorite stress busters. I recently started writing a blog on machine learning(click "Machine learning blog" tab)
