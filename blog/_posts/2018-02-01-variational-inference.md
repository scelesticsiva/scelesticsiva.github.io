type: project
description: The focus of this project is the Variational Inference (VI)  method and some of its applications. In particular, mean-field variational inference is used to find an estimate of the posterior distribution for each of the latent variables. This goal is obtained by decreasing Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of distance between the posterior distribution of the latent variables and a candidate distribution from the mean field of distributions.We begin by explaining the idea behind the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and later we draw the analogy between the EM and the VI methods. Later on, we implement the VI on the univariate and multivariate Gaussian mixture models. In the end, we try to segment images based on their color map.
