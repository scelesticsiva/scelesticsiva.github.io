type: project
description: Neural networks are growing in stature day by day.Neural networks have been hugely successful in approximating fairly complex models.This project aims to implement a three layer network in C to classify the digits in MNIST data. First the baseline serial code was implemented from scratch. Then different optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, Intel intrinsics, OpenMP and CUDA were implemented. The performance of the optimized versions are compared with the serial baseline code and the results are presented.
