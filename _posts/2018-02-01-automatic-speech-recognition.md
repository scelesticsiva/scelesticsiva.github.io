title:  "Variational Inference"

type: project
description: Automatic Speech Recognition is a widely explored field with its early systems based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), but with the advent of neural networks, hybrid systems using HMM - DNN (Deep Neural Network) occupied this space. Later when the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) Loss came about, end-to-end systems started to show promising results. This project is an attempt to obtain state of the art results for Australian English audio samples.
