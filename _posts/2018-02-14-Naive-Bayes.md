Naive Bayes Classifier is a widely used classifier because of its simplicity and ease of implementation. We cannot disregard this classifier as being "naive" and do not use it for complicated tasks. So, if this classifier is powerful enough what is so naive about it?

It is naive because the classifier assumes that the attributes of the data are independent to each other. This might be true in some cases depending on the data we are dealing with.

Let us choose a simple dataset (one which has correlation between attributes and one which does not).
