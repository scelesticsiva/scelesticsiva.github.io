type: project
description: Image compression has an important role in data transfer and storage, especially due to the data explosion that is increasing significantly faster than Mooreâ€™s Law.[1] It is a challenging task since there are highly complex unknown correlations between the pixels, as a result, it is hard to find and recover them.  We want to find a well-compressed representation for images and, design and test networks that are able to recover it successfully in a lossless or lossy way.
